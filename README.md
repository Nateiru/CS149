# CS149 PARALLEL COMPUTING

This is my code and writing assignment for studying [CS149-Fall21](https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall21/lecture/).

However, for the video, you can watch the **CMU 15-418/15-618 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming**, which is just
like **CS149 PARALLEL COMPUTING**:

When I was writing Assignments independently, I came across exercises from different years (not limited to CS149-Fall21). These exercises are valuable for us to practice and reinforce the knowledge we have learned.
